# Remove Myndr extensions
When you previously used either an IntuneWin app or Powershell script to install the Myndr extension on your organisations devices but you're unable to remove them, use this IntuneWin app to clean the registry from any previously set keys, thereby instructing the browsers to uninstall the extension.
